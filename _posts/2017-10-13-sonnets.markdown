About a month ago a coworker of mine at Kickstarter started a new segment at our Engineering meeting -- a musical opener! Our first meeting we had an acoustic rendition of a Fall Out Boy song, which was _amazing_, but we struggled to find an appropriate act for our second meeting. Turns out, it's hard to wrangle people to perform music in front of all their colleagues. Last minute, I contacted the organizer of this segment and offered to do something a little different.

Lately, I've been working on my memory. In order to improve my memory, I've been using a couple memorization tricks and practicing these on Shakespeare's sonnets. So I volunteered to read a sonnet at the meeting. I picked Sonnet 116 since I felt I knew it the best (it was the first I'd memorized) and read it out loud from memory at the top of the meeting. The sonnet:

```
Let me not to the marriage of true minds 
Admit impediments. Love is not love 
Which alters when it alteration finds, 
Or bends with the remover to remove. 
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark 
That looks on tempests and is never shaken; 
It is the star to every wand'ring bark, 
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. 
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks 
Within his bending sickle's compass come; 
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, 
But bears it out even to the edge of doom. 
If this be error and upon me prov'd, 
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.
```

I got a great reception from my supportive coworkers. Reflecting back on it, I think it's pretty amazing that our engineering culture gives room for different types of creative learning.

Programming can be pretty mentally taxing and a way I've found that eases the tax is varying the types of learning and memorization.
