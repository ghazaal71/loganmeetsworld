I'm Logan.

I am a senior infrastructure engineer at BuzzFeed where I concentrate on security and systems operability. I also occasionally assist the newsroom at BuzzFeed News with cybersecurity and technology stories or with making technical tools to aid their work.

I'm using this blog to talk about the things I'm learning both at work and outside work.
