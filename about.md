I'm Logan. I'm a software developer living in New York.

I started my journey in software about three years ago when I started using R for my economics thesis in college. Right after I graduated I decided to pursue software engineering fulltime. I enrolled in a program in Seattle called [Ada Developer's Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/). Ada is a yearlong program for women to study computer science broadly. As part of this year, I got the opportunity to work at [Chef Software](https://www.chef.io/) for 6 months. At Chef, I got really excited about pursuing a career geared towards Ops and systems engineering. A year ago I moved out to New York to begin my career.

Currently, I am an operations/devops/site reliability/whatever title you want engineer at [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com). In my time at Kickstarter, I've concentrated on metrics & monitoring, site reliability, incident response, and some cool [serverless architecture](https://kickstarter.engineering/leveraging-functional-programming-aws-lambda-to-drive-chatops-4b269558d3fb).

I'm using this blog to talk about the things I'm learning both at work and outside work. This blog is very simple. It's really just a place for me to keep some public thoughts, nothing more. Thanks for following along!
