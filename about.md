I'm Logan.

I am a recovering SRE taking a break before starting the next thing. I previous worked as a staff engineer at BuzzFeed concentrating on systems operability, safety, and release engineering. During my time at BuzzFeed I also occasionally assisted the newsroom with cybersecurity and technology stories.

This is my technology-focussed blog. In my non-work time I love to cycle around NYC, read, and learn.
