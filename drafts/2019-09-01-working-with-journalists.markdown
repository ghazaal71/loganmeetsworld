I've worked at BuzzFeed as an SRE for over a year and a half. In that time, I've also helped organize a group within the organization called the Tech + News Working Group (TNWG). At BuzzFeed Tech, we have "7% time" that we're allowed to spend on any learning activity we want and I spend that time working with our newsroom. This is the stated purpose of the TNWG in our code of conduct:

> Our mission is to act as an elevating force for the newsroomâ€™s work through guidance and assistance using our technical skills. Our News team at BuzzFeed strives to shine light on the most important issues facing us. Today, this means a growing focus on the impact of the internet and technology on a range of topics covered by News. As a team of technical experts, we are uniquely equipped to assist in this realm.

Over the last year, we've been consulted on a variety of stories and even helped participate in some cool projects. For example, we built a bot that watches YouTube based on a set of search terms and returns a csv with all the data from its trip [down the rabbit hole](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/down-youtubes-recommendation-rabbithole).

While our mission and work concentrates on what the tech org can offer the newsroom at BuzzFeed, I wanted to write a post about what the newsroom has given me. I have had the privilege of observing our reporters at work and what I've observed is that there are many lessons that carry over to my job as an SRE.

Here are some things about working with journalists that have improved my work.

## Communication communication communication

No one has a harder job with a higher risk than journalists when it comes to explaining complicated content succinctly. I've seen time from breaking story to polished 200-word short take our team minutes. There are deft skills at play here. Journalists know how to put the most important information out first, for sure, but almost more impressively they often do this across multiple desks (breaking news, tech, politics, etc.).

As an SRE, I'm often in a similar situation, but with issues across products. If an incident happens, we have a lot of interested parties to communicate with and we have to do it in a fast and organized way. I've learned from journalists to clear out extraneous noise in moments like these, quickly identify the point people necessary to solve our problem, and to hone our communication skills for these moments. We should have a shared language as a team, and an understanding of what we'll do if something unexpected happens.

## Research is a long game

The best journalists are world-class researchers, and furthermore, expert open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysts. I've picked up lots of tips and tricks from talking to reporters about how they search for information online. It's been a great joy of the TNWG that we can share these insights with one another.

The main lesson I've learned is that research is a long game. Not every story is going to work out. Actually, many of the roads I've seen our staff run down have turned out to be dead ends. This is often something that I've seen us on the tech side have a harder time with. A reporter will come to us with a question and we'll run with it. We'll answer the question and get invested so we keep pursuing the angle. Soon after, the reporter will have moved on to another question or story, but there will be engineers still doggedly looking at the question days later. I've learned from journalists that when a trail runs cold to turn off the road rather than tumble down it eternally. Document what you've learned and where the trail went cold, and move on.

We struggle with this immensely in engineering architecture. You get really invested in a piece of technology or a certain solution that it feels like there is no way to move forward unless you are on that path. This is not true. There's always another solution, another technology, and learning how to admit the trail's run cold is a serious skill.

## Just talk to people

Possibly the hardest thing I could imagine myself doing when I watch reporters work is how many people they have to talk to. Reporters are constantly talking to public relations within governments and companies, keeping in touch with sources, or chatting with other reporters. There's always an influx of

## Control for the most variables

Often we're posed with clarifying questions about technology and at some point in the questioning the reporters will say "What is the most concrete thing we can say here?"

This is why we make MVPs.
