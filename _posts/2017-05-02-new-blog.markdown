I'm starting this new blog! I love writing. I love learning. Writing helps me learn, so I'm starting this blog. I've had blogs in the [past](loganmcdonald.me), but none that were specifically about technical learning. 

I have been a coding for about 3 years and a professional software engineer for one. I want a place where I can keep track of my progress growing my skills. Thus, why not blog about it?

This blog will not strictly be about programming, but more geared towards _learning_. And because I tend to spend most of my time learning about software engineering, I'll spend most of my time writing about that. I am an operations engineer at [Kickstarter](www.kickstarter.com) interested in systems engineering, monitoring, backend engineering, and site resilience.
